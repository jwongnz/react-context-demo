This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
Following Stephen Grinder's tutorial on The Context System with React <br>
The purpose is to demonstrate the React context system, which is similar to the props system except that any nested child can access the context, rather than just direct children.<br>
2 ways to populate context - Default values and Providers <br>
2 ways to read from context - this.context and Consumers (useful for when you want to read from more than one context)
